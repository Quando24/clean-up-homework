# <Clean-up-homework>
## Description
This homework required me to simply "correct" the given code in the html and css files by providing the proper element tags, in order to the make the code more easily readable, for both the developer and for anyone that is not familiar with code. For the css file, I was required to leave behind developer notes, describing what each line of code is doing. Essentially, the corrections that were made logically establishes what each tag is doing per line of code. My motivation and the purpose of me building this project, was to improve my coding skills and help me build essential habits, of which, are creating clean and logical lines of code so if changes are needed, it will be easier for me to make them. It is also for the purpose of making the lines of code easier to explain to someone who is not familar with coding. The problem solved is basically finding new tags to use in order to make the html files more understandable and logical, and the make the css files more logically sound, in case changes are needed. I learned how to develop html and css files in a manner that makes lines of code more simpler for both coders and laymen to understand.

## Installation
In order to install the work onto Github, firstly you have to create an account. Then you have to create a new repository and give it a name. Be sure to make this new repository public and add a readme. Once that is done, there will be a green button, and once clicked, clone will be at the top with three options underneath. Click the ssh option. And then copy the link. Then go to the terminal. open the directory (type in ls) and then change into the specific directory (type in cd and the name of the directory) that you would like to place this project. Then you have to run a git add . command, followed by, a git commit -m "enter description of changes made" command. Then lastly run a git push command to publish the project onto Github.
